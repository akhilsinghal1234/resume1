\section{Projects}

\runsubsection{3D-Gait Recognition} \\
\normalsize Using Deep learning techniques, developed a model to recognize human beings using 3D gait as a biometric. Used Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to generate mesh for human body for a given picture or video. Developed single pipeline to generate human body mesh, train and recognize human on the basis of the 3D gait.	\\

\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space

\runsubsection{Pixlr}	\\
\normalsize Designed a dynamic Website - Pixlr, dedicated for the artists and
photographers to showcase their skills for Database project. Used MySQL as database, PHP \& JavaScript for back-end , HTML \& CSS for front-end development.\\
